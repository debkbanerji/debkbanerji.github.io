Segfaults haunt me, I recompile 'cause I can't see
What I want and I need, everything those lines should be
I'll bet it's horrible, the code that I typed out
And it lacks every fix that I have to live without

Segfaults haunt me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see which nodes I forgot to free
I thought I'd fixed it all, I'd finally got it right
I wonder if this code is all I will debug at night

C's the reason for the teardrops on my spacebar
The only code that keeps on making my threads fall apart
I lose all of the chars I keep reading, don't know why I do

Segfaults haunt me, malloc makes it hard to breathe
And Java runs so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish C could be
They'd better use it right, give it all their love
Look at those beautiful lines and know they're lucky 'cause

C's the reason for the teardrops on my spacebar
The only code that keeps on making my threads fall apart
I lose all of the chars I keep reading, don't know why I do, why I do

So I delete the code
As I turn out the light, I'll use a library
And maybe get some sleep tonight 'cause

C's the reason for the teardrops on my spacebar
The only one with all the memory leaks that break my heart
I lose all of the chars I keep reading, don't know why I do, why I do
C's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And it's all that I need to fall into

Segfaults haunt me, I recompile 'cause I can't see
