I still remember the look on your face
When you pushed to master at 1:58
You didn't test it
So how could I know
You told me it might work
But everything broke today
today

I do recall now, all of that pain
When 4 weeks of coding
Went down the drain
That July 9th
When you broke my heart
All of that code
Lying dead in my arms

So now I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
I never thought you'd make that last commit
Never imagined you'd break all this
Your bug, forever the bug I can't fix

I do remember you put me through hell
When you messed up master, while showing off again
And I rolled my eyes and then
You just merged in
I'm not much for rollbacks
But this time I did

Because you don't like testing, you don't even bother
I hate how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you merged in when I was in the middle of coding something
That might have just saved us from all this destruction

And I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
Never thought you'd make that last commit
Never imagined you'd break all this
Your bug, forever the bug I can't fix

So I'll rollback all the changes that had cost me so much sleep
And I feel you forget just what made all your code so weak
And I'll fish out all my old files if I know just where they are
Hope I know where they are

And I hope it compiles
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
To pray it won't break
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on rewriting those lines

So I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
Never thought you'd make that last commit
Never imagined you'd break all this
Your bug, forever the bug I can't fix

Just like your last commit
Forever the bug I can't fix
Forever the bug I can't fix

Just like your last...
