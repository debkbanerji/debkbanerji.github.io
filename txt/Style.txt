Midnight
I'm looking at the screen in low light
Long time,
The code just may not work or might compile
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since those recurses worked for you (worked for you)

And I know they're nice to read but I
know exactly where this leads and I
Watch 'em go 'round and 'round each time

You got that blood red, half dead look in your eye
And I got that well placed, well spaced code that you like
And when we go write new lines, we indent every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

All of those javadocs are right where they should be
And all of that camel case just fills up the screen
And when we go write new lines, we indent every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the code
An exception's thrown
It's not caught and now we're in the danger zone, Hmm, Yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out compiling code that doesn't work, that doesn't work"

He says, "I don't know what to do though I
made it look cool" and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'cause you got that blood red, half dead look in your eye
And I got that well placed, well spaced code that you like
And when we go write new lines, we indent every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

All of those javadocs are right where they should be
And all of that camel case just fills up the screen
And when we go write new lines, we indent every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Fix the code
Just fix the code, yeah.
just fix the code
(Out of style)

You got that blood red, half dead look in your eye
And I got that well placed, well spaced code that you like
And when we go write new lines, we indent every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style
