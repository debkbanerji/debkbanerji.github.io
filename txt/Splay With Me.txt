Guess it's true, I'm not good at building maps
But I'll use a tree cause I don't like hash
My code never seems to go to plan
And the lines I write just get out of hand

Oh, won't you splay with me?
That node's all I need
Won't use hash it's clear to see
So darling, splay with me

Why am I so emotional?
Writing out these maps makes me lose control
And deep down I know the speed is worse
But it's still log(n) so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you splay with me?
That node's all I need
Won't use hash it's clear to see
So darling, splay with me

Oh, won't you splay with me?
That node's all I need
Won't use hash it's clear to see
So darling, splay with me

Oh, won't you splay with me?
That node's all I need
Won't use hash it's clear to see
So darling, splay with me
