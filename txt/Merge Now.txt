I am not the kind of sort,
That can be implemented in place on every occasion,
But you don't have the kind of list,
That should be playing well with quick sort

You start to second guess,
All of the decisions that put you through hell,
And you are looking for the n-square,
Somewhere back inside the codebase,
Making it run slowly,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

Don't quicksort, recompile now,
It's the only way you'll save,
All the code that you worked for
Don't split around the pivot now,
You need to hear me out,
When I say merge now

All your code is unchanged,
And the program runs so slowly,
That it feels like a death march,
And you are feeling so uncertain,
It seems that you're so unexcited by the sloppy code you see
You choose all your pivots randomly
But I know you wish you chose me,
You wish you chose me, don't you?

Don't quicksort, recompile now,
It's the only way you'll save,
All the code that you worked for
Don't split around the pivot now,
You need to hear me out,
When I say merge now

Don't quicksort, recompile now,
It's the only way you'll save,
All the code that you worked for
Don't split around the pivot now,
Your time is running out,
So I say merge now

You here the data say,
Merge now or forever hold your peace,
There's a silence, there's your last chance,
You stand up with shaking hands,
And hit delete,
Horrified looks from engineers in the room,
And they're only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of sort,
That can be implemented in place on every occasion,
But you don't have the kind of list,
That should be playing well with quick sort

So don't quicksort, recompile now,
It's the only way you'll save,
All the code that you worked for
Don't split around the pivot now,
You need to hear me out,
When I say merge now

And you say, I'll recompile now,
It's time I went and saved all the code that I worked for,
Worst case is less than n-square now,
So glad you were around and you said merge now
