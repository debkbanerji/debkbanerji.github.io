Freed all those nodes
I didn't need the pain
program's no longer fast
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it's frozen

But something happened
As I'm writing all this code for you
Memory's leaking to the ground
I know it's true
And I'm recompiling
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
Don't know what to do
They tell me malloc's okay
But they don't know the truth
My code's crippled by the loops
That I keep on closing
The code is broken and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding RAM
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
The code is broken

So much to fear
My program's slowing down
Every time I malloc
It just fills me with doubt
Yet I know that my goal
Is to keep it from leaking

And nothing's greater than the rush that comes with clearing space
But when I check with Valgrind
All my code's defaced
And everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
Don't tell me what to do
They tell me malloc's okay
But they don't know the truth
My code's crippled by the loops
That I keep on closing
The code is broken and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding RAM
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
The code is broken

And it's draining all the speed
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be freeing these nodes
For everyone to see

I don't care what they say
Don't know what to do
They tell me malloc's okay
But they don't know the truth
My code's crippled by the loops
That I keep on closing
The code is broken and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding RAM
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
The code is broken and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding RAM
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
The code is broken and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding RAM
