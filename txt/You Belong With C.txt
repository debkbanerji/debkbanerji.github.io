You're on your own writing Java
It's upset, it throws exceptions and the console turns to red
'Cause it doesn't know those pointers like I do.

You're writing code, it's a typical Friday night.
You're typing out the kind of methods you just don't like.
And it doesn't preprocess code like I do.

But It's got objects
You hate pointers
It has util
And I'm lackin' features
Dreaming about the day when you compile and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with C,
You belong with C.

Writing out code for managing memory
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing as you write main thinking to myself,
"Hey, just use gcc."

And you've got the code
That could light up this whole town.
You haven't run that in a while
Java slowed you down.

You say it's fast I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing making calls like that?

But It's got objects
You hate pointers
It has util
And I'm lackin' features
Dreaming about the day when you compile and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with C.

Standing by compiling at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with C,
You belong with C.

Oh, I remember you rewriting your code
In the middle of the night.
'Cause include makes you laugh
When import makes you cry.
I know your code is slow,
In those virtual machines.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's writing C.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with C.

Standing by compiling at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with C,
You belong with C.

You belong with C.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with C?
You belong with C.
