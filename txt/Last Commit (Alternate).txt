I still remember the look on your face
When I pushed to master at 1:58
I didn't test it
So how could I know
I thought that it might work
But everything broke today
today

I do recall now, all of that pain
When 4 weeks of coding
Went down the drain
That July 9th
When I broke your heart
All of that code
Lying dead in my arms

So now I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
Guess I'll just undo my last commit
Never imagined I'd break all this
My bug, forever the bug I can't fix

I do remember I put you through hell
When I messed up master, while showing off again
And you rolled your eyes and then
I just merged in
I'm not much for rollbacks
But this time I did

Because I don't like testing, I don't even bother
I hate how I led us to all of this horror
How I merged in when you were in the middle of coding something
That might have just saved us from all this destruction

And I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
Guess I'll just undo my last commit
Never imagined I'd break all this
My bug, forever the bug I can't fix

So I'll rollback all the changes that had cost me so much sleep
And I feel you forget just what made all my code so weak
And I'll fish out all my old files if I know just where they are
Hope I know where they are

And I hope it compiles
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
To pray it won't break
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on rewriting those lines

So I'll go patch up the branch
Using old code
All that I know is
I don't know what I would do without Git
Guess I'll just undo my last commit
Never imagined I'd break all this
My bug, forever the bug I can't fix

Just like my last commit
Forever the bug I can't fix
Forever the bug I can't fix

Just like my last...
