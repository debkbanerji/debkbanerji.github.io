When you build the tree, but it won't succeed
When you write what looks fine, but not what you need
When it's due next day, and you can't sleep
It won't recurse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose some code you can't replace
When traversals work, but they go to waste
Could it be worse?

Tests will guide you home
And make right your code
And they will try to fix you

And as the lines just seem to grow
When you wrote too much to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what it's worth

Tests will guide you home
And make right your code
And they will try to fix you

You miss an edge case
When you lose some code you cannot replace
You miss an edge case and I
You miss an edge case
I promise you you will learn from your mistakes
You miss an edge case and I

Tests will guide you home
And make right your code
And they will try to fix you
