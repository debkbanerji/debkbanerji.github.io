Undo that change
Undo my dread
Undo these voices inside my head
Show me your code
Tell me no lies
Just change it back, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you write C if you don't
I can't make you compile something you won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will rewrite my part and turn off the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you write C, if you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The code that will break when you write in C
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to rewrite these lines
And I will rewrite these lines

'Cause I can't make you write C if you don't
I can't make you compile something you won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will rewrite my part and turn off the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you write C, if you don't
