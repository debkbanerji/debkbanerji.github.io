I saw this program giving me hell
I was looking for help from somebody else
When I could have spent those moments fixing you

All of this code going down in the drain
all that I did was whine and complain
When I could have spent those hours fixing you

I kept on waiting for someone to save me
From typing that bug that I knew
I look through that code
And I could have been fixing you

Now I face this problem that I've always known
Trying to fix memory leaks on my own
I could have spent that whole night fixing you

I kept on waiting for someone to save me
From typing that bug that I knew
I look through that code
And I could have been fixing you

Now that this function has been redefined
All of this memory can be reassigned
I would have spent this whole life fixing you

I kept on waiting for someone to save me
From typing that bug that I knew
From typing that bug that I knew
From typing that bug that I knew
I wasted my time
When I could have been fixing you
