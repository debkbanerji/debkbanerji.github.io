                    around and change my own lines.<br>I go back to BSTs all the time.<br><br>I miss your nice code,
                    your short lines,<br>So good to me, so right<br>But then you failed all of those tests that
                    September night<br>The first time recursion made me cry.<br><br>Maybe this is wishful thinking,<br>Probably
                    mindless dreaming,<br>But if I had the chance, I swear I'd code you right.<br><br>I'd go back in

                    clear to see<br>So darling, splay with me<br><br>Why am I so emotional?<br>Writing out these maps
                    makes me lose control<br>And deep down I know the speed is worse<br>But it's still log(n) so it
                    doesn't hurt<br><br>Oh, won't you splay with me?<br>That node's all I need<br>Won't use hash it's
                    clear to see<br>So darling, splay with me<br><br>Oh, won't you splay with me?<br>That node's all I

                    frozen<br><br>But something happened<br>As I'm writing all this code for you<br>Memory's leaking to
                    the ground<br>I know it's true<br>And I'm recompiling<br>Thinking I'm going crazy<br><br>But I don't
                    care what they say<br>Don't know what to do<br>They tell me malloc's okay<br>But they don't know the
                    truth<br>My code's crippled by the loops<br>That I keep on closing<br>The code is broken and

                    RAM<br>Keep bleeding<br>Keep, keep bleeding RAM<br>The memory's leaking<br><br>So much to fear<br>My
                    program's slowing down<br>Every time I malloc<br>It just fills me with doubt<br>Yet I know that my
                    goal<br>Is to keep it from leaking<br><br>And nothing's greater than the rush that comes with
                    clearing space<br>But when I check with Valgrind<br>All my code's defaced<br>And everyone around
                    me<br>Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe<br><br>But I don't care what they say<br>Don't know
                    what to do<br>They tell me malloc's okay<br>But they don't know the truth<br>My code's crippled by
                    the loops<br>That I keep on closing<br>The code is broken and I<br><br>Keep bleeding<br>Keep, keep
                    bleeding RAM<br>I keep bleeding<br>I keep, keep bleeding RAM<br>Keep bleeding<br>Keep, keep bleeding
                    RAM<br>The code is broken<br><br>And it's draining all the speed<br>Oh they find it hard to
                    believe<br>I'll be freeing these nodes<br>For everyone to see<br><br>I don't care what they say<br>Don't
