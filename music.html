                    you was "Goodbye".<br><br>So this is me swallowing my pride,<br>Typing in front of you saying, "I'm

                    missing you.<br>Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.<br>I'd go back to BSTs, turn
                    around and change my own lines.<br>I go back to BSTs all the time.<br><br>I miss your nice code,
                    your short lines,<br>So good to me, so right<br>But then you failed all of those tests that
                    September night<br>The first time recursion made me cry.<br><br>Maybe this is wishful thinking,<br>Probably
                    mindless dreaming,<br>But if I had the chance, I swear I'd code you right.<br><br>I'd go back in
                    time and change it but I can't.<br>So if I'm stuck with look ahead I understand.<br><br>But this is
                    me swallowing my pride<br>Typing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for those lines."<br>And I go
                    back to BSTs...<br>It turns out AVL's nothing but missing you,<br>Wishing I'd realized what I had
                    when you were mine.<br>I'd go back to BSTs, turn around and make the code right.<br>I'd go back to

                    I saw this program giving me hell<br>I was looking for help from somebody else<br>When I could have
                    spent those moments fixing you<br><br>All of this code going down in the drain<br>all that I did was
                    whine and complain<br>When I could have spent those hours fixing you<br><br>I kept on waiting for
                    someone to save me<br>From typing that bug that I knew<br>I look through that code<br>And I could
                    have been fixing you<br><br>Now I face this problem that I've always known<br>Trying to fix memory
                    leaks on my own<br>I could have spent that whole night fixing you<br><br>I kept on waiting for
                    someone to save me<br>From typing that bug that I knew<br>I look through that code<br>And I could
                    have been fixing you<br><br>Now that this function has been redefined<br>All of this memory can be
                    reassigned<br>I would have spent this whole life fixing you<br><br>I kept on waiting for someone to
                    save me<br>From typing that bug that I knew<br>From typing that bug that I knew<br>From typing that
                    bug that I knew<br>I wasted my time<br>When I could have been fixing you

                    When you build the tree, but it won't succeed<br>When you write what looks fine, but not what you
                    need<br>When it's due next day, and you can't sleep<br>It won't recurse<br>And the tears come
                    streaming down your face<br>When you lose some code you can't replace<br>When traversals work, but
                    they go to waste<br>Could it be worse?<br><br>Tests will guide you home<br>And make right your
                    code<br>And they will try to fix you<br><br>And as the lines just seem to grow<br>When you wrote too
                    much to let it go<br>But if you never try you'll never know<br>Just what it's worth<br><br>Tests
                    will guide you home<br>And make right your code<br>And they will try to fix you<br><br>You miss an
                    edge case<br>When you lose some code you cannot replace<br>You miss an edge case and I<br>You miss
                    an edge case<br>I promise you you will learn from your mistakes<br>You miss an edge case and
                    I<br><br>Tests will guide you home<br>And make right your code<br>And they will try to fix you
